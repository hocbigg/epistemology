# Summary

The Epistemology curriculum is a **complete education in Epistemology** using online materials.

## Organization

This repository is organized into three main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;
- **[Projects](projects.md)**: support learning through practical application throughout the curriculum.

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Practical work is integrated through the [Projects section](projects.md) and may be undertaken alongside coursework.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

### Core Sections

The following sections form the essential backbone of epistemology. Study them **in this exact order**:

**Foundational Tools for Epistemology**

**Core Epistemology: Knowledge and Belief**

**Sources and Structure of Justification**
