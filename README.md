## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

The following sections form the essential backbone of epistemology. Study them **in this exact order**:

**I. Foundational Tools for Epistemology**

**II. Core Epistemology: Knowledge and Belief**

**III. Sources and Structure of Justification**

**IV. Skepticism and Epistemic Limits**

These four sections give you the central questions, classic debates, and basic conceptual vocabulary that almost every serious discussion in epistemology builds upon.

### Specialization Tracks

Once you have finished sections I–IV, the remaining sections are optional specialization tracks. They explore particular directions or applications of epistemological thinking. You do **not** need to do all of them.

The specialization tracks are:

- V. Probability and Formal Reasoning
- VI. Social and Applied Epistemology
- VII. Epistemology of Science
- VIII. Advanced and Interdisciplinary Epistemology

Pick based on your interests and goals after finishing the core:

- Choose **V. Probability and Formal Reasoning** if you enjoy mathematics, logic, precise modeling, or want to understand how probability and evidence work in detail.
- Choose **VI. Social and Applied Epistemology** if you are interested in how knowledge works in groups, institutions, online environments, politics, trust, misinformation, or questions of fairness and injustice.
- Choose **VII. Epistemology of Science** if you want to understand how scientific knowledge is produced, justified, and distinguished from non-science.
- Choose **VIII. Advanced and Interdisciplinary Epistemology** if you are curious about connections between epistemology and artificial intelligence, decision-making under uncertainty, or highly technical/formal approaches.
