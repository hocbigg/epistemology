# Advanced Topics

- [Probability and Formal Reasoning](#probability-and-formal-reasoning)
- [Social and Applied Epistemology](#social-and-applied-epistemology)
- [Epistemology of Science](#epistemology-of-science)
- [Advanced and Interdisciplinary Epistemology](#advanced-and-interdisciplinary-epistemology)

Once you have finished sections I–IV, the remaining sections are optional specialization tracks. They explore particular directions or applications of epistemological thinking. You do **not** need to do all of them.

The specialization tracks are:

- V. Probability and Formal Reasoning
- VI. Social and Applied Epistemology
- VII. Epistemology of Science
- VIII. Advanced and Interdisciplinary Epistemology

Pick based on your interests and goals after finishing the core:

- Choose **Probability and Formal Reasoning** if you enjoy mathematics, logic, precise modeling, or want to understand how probability and evidence work in detail.
- Choose **Social and Applied Epistemology** if you are interested in how knowledge works in groups, institutions, online environments, politics, trust, misinformation, or questions of fairness and injustice.
- Choose **Epistemology of Science** if you want to understand how scientific knowledge is produced, justified, and distinguished from non-science.
- Choose **Advanced and Interdisciplinary Epistemology** if you are curious about connections between epistemology and artificial intelligence, decision-making under uncertainty, or highly technical/formal approaches.
